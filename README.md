PhenoDP is a deep learning-based tool for assisting in the diagnosis of Mendelian genetic diseases.
It requires at least two files to be prepared in advance:

JC_sim_dict.pkl
a file measuring the JC similarity of all HPO terms to all diseases, with data type as a dictionary. 

node_embedding_dict_T5_gcn.pkl
a dictionary file containing semantic vectors generated by PSD-HPOEncoder for each term

transformer_encoder_infonce_norm.pth (optional) 
pre-trained PCL-HPOEncoder model parameter file
This file needs to be pre-loaded when using the recommender.

The generation process of all files is shown in the .ipynb file.

The three files used in our experiment will be uploaded to URL: https://... (to be updated)
