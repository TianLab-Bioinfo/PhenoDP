# PhenoDP

PhenoDP requires at least two files to be prepared in advance:

## Required Files

### JC_sim_dict.pkl

A file measuring the JC similarity of all HPO terms to all diseases, with data type as a dictionary.

### node_embedding_dict_T5_gcn.pkl

A dictionary file containing semantic vectors generated by PSD-HPOEncoder for each term.

### transformer_encoder_infonce_norm.pth (optional)

Pre-trained PCL-HPOEncoder model parameter file. This file needs to be pre-loaded when using the recommender.

## File Generation

The generation process of all files is shown in the `.ipynb` file.

## File Upload

The three files used in our experiment will be uploaded to URL:
