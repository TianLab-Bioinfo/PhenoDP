# PhenoDP Latest Version Description

In this GitHub repository, we provide the files involved in training and using PhenoDP, as well as a demonstration of how to use the latest version of PhenoDP. For details on the PhenoDP code files, please refer to the `code_in_version_2` folder. The `data` folder contains synthetic cases generated by DeepSeek-R1-671B, which serve as training texts for the summarizer. We also provide disease entries from OMIM or Orphanet, HPO annotations, and HPO definition sentences. Additionally, the three datasets involved in the benchmark are included.

## Environment for Ranker and Recommender
- **Python**: 3.7.3
- **pyhpo**: 3.3.1
- **torch**: 1.9.0+cu111
- **torchaudio**: 0.9.0
- **torchvision**: 0.10.0+cu111
- **transformers**: 4.45.0

## Environment for Summarizer
- **torch**: 2.0.1+cu118
- **tokenizers**: 0.20.1

## Key Updates in the Latest Version
In the latest version, we have separated the Python environments for the summarizer and the Ranker/Recommender. This decision was made primarily because the summarizer can utilize more advanced language models to ensure enhanced functionality. This inevitably requires the use of more advanced versions of Torch. However, the Ranker and Recommender, which are based on Torch 1.9.0, may encounter errors when using these more advanced Torch versions. To avoid such errors, we have maintained Torch 1.9.0 for the Ranker and Recommender, while allowing the summarizer to use any advanced version of Torch.
