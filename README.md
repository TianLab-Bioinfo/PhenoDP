# PhenoDP

## Instructions

- Please refer to the [./code_notebooks/Readme.md](./code_notebooks/Readme.md) for tool usage instructions.
- For the usage tutorial, refer to the [./code](./code).

PhenoDP requires at least two files to be prepared in advance:

## Required Files

### JC_sim_dict.pkl

A file measuring the JC similarity of all HPO terms to all diseases, with data type as a dictionary.

### node_embedding_dict_T5_gcn.pkl

A dictionary file containing semantic vectors generated by PSD-HPOEncoder for each term.

### transformer_encoder_infonce_norm.pth (optional)

Pre-trained PCL-HPOEncoder model parameter file. This file needs to be pre-loaded when using the Recommender.

### flan-model.pth (optional)
Pre-trained Summarizer model parameter file. This file needs to be pre-loaded when using the Summarizer.

## File Generation

The generation process of all files is shown in the `.ipynb` file.

## File Upload

The files generated in our experiment can be accessed from the following link:
