# PhenoDP is a deep learning-based tool for assisting in the diagnosis of Mendelian genetic diseases.
# It requires at least two files to be prepared in advance:
# JC_sim_dict.pkl (a file measuring the JC similarity of all HPO terms to all diseases, with data type as a dictionary. The first-level keys are HPO_term.id, and each item value is still a dictionary.
# This dictionary represents the JC similarity between the HPO_term and a specific OMIM disease. The second-level dictionary keys are Omim_term.id, and each item value is a number representing the similarity score.

# node_embedding_dict_T5_gcn.pkl (a dictionary file containing semantic vectors generated by PSD-HPOEncoder for each term)
# The dictionary keys are HPO IDs, and the values are 1*256 semantic embeddings.

# transformer_encoder_infonce_norm.pth (optional) (pre-trained PCL-HPOEncoder model parameter file)
# This file needs to be pre-loaded when using the recommender.
